`sapfluxnetr` R package provides tools for a tidy data analysis for the first
sap flow measurements global database 
([SAPFLUXNET Project](http://sapfluxnet.creaf.cat)). In this vignette you
will learn how to install the package, download the data and get started with
some data metrics.

## Installing the package

`sapfluxnetr` is in the CRAN, so the installation is straightforward:

```{r cran_install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('sapfluxnetr')
```

Development versions of the package reside in github. If you want the latest
updates, **and also the latest bugs** ( be advised ;) ), please install the
package from the *devel* branch of the
[github repository](https://github.com/sapfluxnet/sapfluxnetr) with the
`remotes` package:

```{r github_inst, eval=FALSE}
# if (!require(remotes)) {install.packages('remotes')}
remotes::install_github(
  'sapfluxnet/sapfluxnetr', ref = 'devel',
  build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual", "--build-vignettes")
)
```

Now you can load the package, along with the `tidyverse`-related packages, as 
they will be needed later:

```{r pkg_load}
library(sapfluxnetr)
# tidyverse
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


## Download the data

  > *.zip* file is about 3GB. Unzipped folders use about 24GB of disk space.
    Please check thet you have enough space available before downloading and
    unzipping the files.


### Zenodo

Data is publicly available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3697807) to
download. You can manually download the data or use a *programmatic* approach:

    
```{r downzip, eval = FALSE}
# download the data
download.file(
  url = "https://zenodo.org/record/3971689/files/0.1.5.zip?download=1",
  destfile = '0.1.5.zip'
)
# unzip the data
# BE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST 24GB OF DISK SPACE
unzip("0.1.5.zip")
# check if files are present
list.files(file.path('0.1.5', 'RData', 'plant'))
list.files(file.path('0.1.5', 'csv', 'plant'))
```


### SAPFLUXNET Data structure

SAPFLUXNET database structure is as follows:

```
0.1.5 (database version number)
  |
  |-- RData
  |    |
  |    |-- plant
  |    |-- sapwood
  |    |-- leaf
  |
  |-- csv
  |    |
  |    |-- plant
  |    |-- sapwood
  |    |-- leaf
```

`RData` folder contains the RData files for each site divided by sap flow units
level:

  - `plant` sites with sap flow plant level units available.  
  - `sapwood` sites with sap flow sapwood level units available.  
  - `leaf` sites with sap flow leaf level units available.

`csv` folder contains the csv files (9 files, 5 of metadata, 2 of data and 2 more
for the data flags) for each units level available and site. We do not provide
scripts or functions to work with the csv files, only the RData objects.

To start working with the data, you have two options:

  - If working in RStudio, create a project in the data root folder (`0.1.5` in
    this example) and follow the examples in this vignette to get started.
  
  - If not, set the data root folder (`0.1.5` in this example) as the working
    directory with `setwd` and follow the examples in this vignette to get
    started.

>DISCLAIMER: In order to be able to build the vignette in the CRAN tests
 the following examples will be based on a small subset of SAPFLUXNET Data,
 composed by `ARG_TRE`, `ARG_MAZ` and `AUS_CAN_ST2_MIX` sites.
 Outputs will vary if you follow the vignette examples with the complete
 database.

## Inspecting a site

First, let's get used to the data structure thet SAPFLUXNET provides, and
for thet we will choose a site and start playing with it.

### Loading a site

In this example we will use the `ARG_MAZ` site, as it is small and it will be
fast seeing the package capabilities. There are sites like `FRA_PUE` 100 times
bigger then this, but as one can imagine, the time is also increasing when
analyzing those bigger datasets.  
So, let's read the data in the environment:

```{r read_and_inspect, eval=FALSE}
# read the data
arg_maz <- read_sfn_data('ARG_MAZ', folder = 'RData/plant')

# see a brief summary of the site:
arg_maz
```

```{r read_internals, echo=FALSE}
# read the data
arg_maz <- read_sfn_data('ARG_MAZ', folder = folder)

# see a brief summary of the site:
arg_maz
```

At first glance, we know by this summary thet is an Argentinian forest (first
three letters of the site code are always the country code),
contributed by Sebastian Pfautsch and Pablo Peri with 5 *Nothofagus pumilio*
trees measured along 15 days in 2009. Also we can see the environmental variables
measured (`ta`, `rh`, `vpd`, `sw_in`, `ws`, `precip`, `swc_shallow`, `ppfd_in`
and `ext_rad`) and the biome classification. Finally, we can see thet the
environmental data has some flags (more on thet later).

### Accessing the data and the metadata

`sfn_data` objects have different slots containing the different data, each of
one has a getter function (see `?sfn_get_methods` and
`vignette('sfn-data-classes', package = 'sapfluxnetr'` for detailed info):

```{r accesors_data}
# sapf data with original site timestamp
arg_maz_sapf <- get_sapf_data(arg_maz, solar = FALSE)
arg_maz_sapf

# env_data with calculated aparent solar time
arg_maz_env <- get_env_data(arg_maz, solar = TRUE)
arg_maz_env
```

You can see thet the TIMESTAMP variable changes between both kinds of data. That
is because the TIMESTAMP returned is controlled by the `solar` parameter
(see `?sfn_get_methods`).

Metadata can be accessed in the same way:

```{r accesors_md}
arg_maz_site_md <- get_site_md(arg_maz)
arg_maz_site_md
arg_maz_stand_md <- get_stand_md(arg_maz)
arg_maz_stand_md
arg_maz_species_md <- get_species_md(arg_maz)
arg_maz_species_md
arg_maz_plant_md <- get_plant_md(arg_maz)
arg_maz_plant_md
arg_maz_env_md <- get_env_md(arg_maz)
arg_maz_env_md
```

If in doubt about some of the metadata variables (what it means, units...) a
description can be obtained from `describe_md_variable` function:

```{r describe}
# what is env_ta?
describe_md_variable('env_ta')

# or pl_species?
describe_md_variable('pl_species')
```

There is also some getters thet can come in handy sometimes. `get_timestamp` and
`get_solar_timestamp` access to the original timestamp and the apparent solar
time timestamp. `get_si_code` access to the site code. See
`vignette('sfn-data-classes', package = 'sapfluxnetr'` for more info.

#### Flags

`sfn_data` objects also have two more slots, accessed with `get_sapf_flags` and
`get_env_flags`.

```{r get_flags}
arg_maz_sapf_flags <- get_sapf_flags(arg_maz, solar = TRUE)
arg_maz_sapf_flags

arg_maz_env_flags <- get_env_flags(arg_maz, solar = TRUE)
arg_maz_env_flags
```

This datasets store any flag thet each data point may have (possible outlier,
data removed in the Quality Check of the data...). For a complete list of
flags possible values see `vignette('data-flags', package = 'sapfluxnetr')`.
As an example, let's see which values are marked as "RANGE_WARN" (a warning
indicating thet the value may be out of normal variable range):

```{r out_range}
arg_maz_env_flags %>%
  filter_all(any_vars(stringr::str_detect(., 'RANGE_WARN')))
```

We see thet the out of range warnings refer to wind variable. We can cross the
data to see which values of wind speed are giving the warnings,

```{r crossing_flags}
arg_maz_env_flags %>%
  filter_all(any_vars(stringr::str_detect(., 'RANGE_WARN'))) %>%
  semi_join(arg_maz_env, ., by = 'TIMESTAMP') %>%
  select(TIMESTAMP, ws)
```

and confirm thet the warnings refer to values above the "usual" wind speed
maximum.

### Plotting an object

We can also plot the different data with the help of `sfn_plot` function. It will
return `ggplot` objects thet can be modified afterwards:

```{r sapf_plot, fig.width=6}
sfn_plot(arg_maz, type = 'sapf', solar = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~ Tree) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

```{r env_plot, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
sfn_plot(arg_maz, type = 'env', solar = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~ Variable, scales = 'free_y') +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

We can also plot environmental variables individually (with the `type` argument),
or an environmental variable *versus* the sap flow measurements (with the
`formula_env` argument). See `?sfn_plot` for a complete description of the
available plots.

```{r vpd_and_vs, fig.show='hold'}
# vpd individually
sfn_plot(arg_maz, type = 'vpd', solar = TRUE)
# vpd vs sapf
sfn_plot(arg_maz, formula_env = ~vpd, solar = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

### Aggregation 

SAPFLUXET data is stored as sub-daily measures with different time step between
sites (ranging from 10 minutes to 2 hours).  
`sapfluxnetr` offers some simple, yet powerful aggregation functions returning
pre-defined statistics: `daily_metrics`, `monthly_metrics`, `predawn_metrics`,
`midday_metrics`, `daylight_metrics` and `nightly_metrics`.  
`daily_metrics` and `monthly_metrics` perform a daily and monthly aggregation,
respectively. `predawn_metrics`, `midday_metrics`, `daylight_metrics` and
`nightly_metrics` perform daily or monthly aggregations (controlled by the
`period` argument) only by hour-defined intervals. All the aggregations are
performed both for sap flow and environmental data.  


Predefined calculated statistics are:

1. *mean*
1. *standard deviation*
1. *accumulated* for the precipitation data
1. *data coverage* (percentage of period covered by the raw data)
1. *quantile 95*
1. *diurnal centroid* (Only calculated **for sap flow** measurements when using
   `daily_metrics`, see `?diurnal_centroid` for limitations in the calculation
   of this metric)

Let's see some examples:

```{r daily}
arg_maz_daily <- daily_metrics(arg_maz, solar = TRUE)

names(arg_maz_daily)
names(arg_maz_daily[['sapf']])
names(arg_maz_daily[['env']])
```

We can see thet results are divided in `sapf` and `env` and inside each of them
the metrics are indicated by the end of the variable names.  
This way we can select specific variables, for example the 0.95 quantile of sap
flow measures:

```{r daily_sapf_gen_q99}
arg_maz_daily[['sapf']] %>%
  select(TIMESTAMP, ends_with('q_95'))
```

The same is applicable to the environmental data, in this case the mean values:

```{r daily_sapf_md_mean}
arg_maz_daily[['env']] %>%
  select(TIMESTAMP, ends_with('mean'))
```

If interested in custom metrics or custom aggregations, there is a generic
function, `sfn_metrics` thet allows for customization of the statistics to
calculate and the periods to aggregate. See `?sfn_metrics` and
`vignette('custom-aggregation'. package = 'sapfluxnetr')` for more details
about it.

#### TIMESTAMP format in aggregations

It's worth to mention thet aggregated TIMESTAMPS are fixed to the **beginning**
of the period aggregated, meaning thet data from `2018-01-01 00:00:00` to
`2018-01-01 23:59:59` are aggregated as `2018-01-01 00:00:00`.  
You can change this using the `side` parameter (see `?sfn_metrics`)

#### Tidy metrics

The default returned object for the aggregation functions is a list with
the sap flow and the environmental data, but given thet usually is more
comfortable to have all data (sap flow and environmental) and ancillary data
(metadata) altogether in a tidy data frame (each row an observation), all
aggregation functions have an argument, `tidy` thet can be set to *TRUE*
to obtain this kind of data frame. We will cover this in the
["Tidy metrics"](#tidymetrics) section.

## Working with multiple sites

Getting the insights about one site is interesting, but getting the insights
of a common group of sites could be even more interesting. `sapfluxnetr` allows
filtering sites by metadata values (biome, country, species...) and work
with them as a unique set.

### Building the metadata database {#metadatadatabase}

First thing we have to do is creating a metadata database. It is not mandatory,
but filtering sites by metadata can be a time/resources consuming step
if we have to temporary build the database each time we want filter sites. So,
let's create a cached metadata database. This will take some minutes, so maybe
it is a good moment to prepare a hot beverage ;)

```{r metadata_database, eval = FALSE}
sfn_metadata <- read_sfn_metadata(folder = 'RData/plant', .write_cache = TRUE)
```

```{r metadata_database_real, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# sfn_metadata <- read_sfn_metadata(folder = folder, .write_cache = TRUE)
sfn_metadata <- sapfluxnetr:::.write_metadata_cache(folder = folder, .dry = TRUE)
```

The important bit here is `.write_cache = TRUE`. This will write a file called
`.metadata_cache.RData` containing all the metadata for all sites present in
`folder`. This file will be used any time we will filter the metadata, so there
is no need of accessing all the data again.  
If we take a look at `sfn_metadata` we can see a list with 5 data frames, one for
each metadata class (site, stand, species, plant and environmental metadata).

```{r md_db_str}
# access plant metadata
sfn_metadata[['plant_md']]
```

### Listing the sites in a folder and filtering by metadata

Now thet we have our metadata database built, we can inspect the site codes
in a folder with `sfn_sites_in_folder`:

```{r sfn_sites_in_folder, eval=FALSE}
folder <- 'RData/plant/'
sites <- sfn_sites_in_folder(folder)
sites
```

```{r sfn_sites_in_folder_real, echo=FALSE}
sites <- sfn_sites_in_folder(folder)
sites
```


We can filter these sites by any metadata variable, to select those thet met
some criteria. This is done with `filter_sites_by_md`. As a first try, let's
list all sites belonging to temperate forests (woodland/shrubland included):

```{r filtering_by_md, eval=FALSE}
temperate <- sfn_sites_in_folder(folder) %>%
  filter_sites_by_md(
    si_biome %in% c('Woodland/Shrubland', 'Temperate forest'),
    metadata = sfn_metadata
  )

temperate
```

```{r filtering_by_md_real, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
temperate <- sfn_sites_in_folder(folder) %>%
  filter_sites_by_md(
    si_biome %in% c('Woodland/Shrubland', 'Temperate forest'),
    metadata = sfn_metadata
  )
temperate
```

You can combine all filters you want:

```{r filters_combined, eval=FALSE}
temperate_hr <- sfn_sites_in_folder(folder) %>%
  filter_sites_by_md(
    si_biome %in% c('Woodland/Shrubland', 'Temperate forest'),
    pl_sens_meth == 'HR',
    metadata = sfn_metadata
  )

temperate_hr
```

```{r filters_combined_real, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
temperate_hr <- sfn_sites_in_folder(folder) %>%
  filter_sites_by_md(
    si_biome %in% c('Woodland/Shrubland', 'Temperate forest'),
    pl_sens_meth == 'HR',
    metadata = sfn_metadata
  )
temperate_hr
```

Remember thet you can get all the info from a metadata variable with
`describe_md_variable`, and also you can get a complete list of metadata
variables for filtering with `sfn_vars_to_filter`:

```{r vars_to_filter}
sfn_vars_to_filter()

# and see what values we must use for filtering by pl_sens_meth
describe_md_variable('pl_sens_meth')
```

### sfn_data_multi objects

We can load all temperate sites with a simple pipe

```{r multi, eval=FALSE}
temperate_sites <- temperate %>%
  read_sfn_data(folder = 'RData/plant')
temperate_sites
```

```{r multi_real, echo=FALSE}
temperate_sites <- temperate %>%
  read_sfn_data(folder = folder)
temperate_sites
```

This creates an `sfn_data_multi` object, which is just a list, but adapted to
contain `sfn_data` objects. Main functions of `sapfluxnetr` work with this type
of objects. As in any list, we can access the sites:

```{r mutil_site}
# the following is the same as temperate_sites[[3]] or
# temperate_sites$AUS_CAN_ST2_MIX
temperate_sites[['AUS_CAN_ST2_MIX']]
```

### Multi aggregation

Now we can aggregate all sites at once

```{r multi_aggregation}
temperate_aggregated <- temperate_sites %>%
  daily_metrics()

names(temperate_aggregated)
```

and *voilÃ *, all sites aggregated and stored in a list, so we can start working
with the data.

## Tidy metrics {#tidymetrics}

Most of the times it comes in handy to have a tidy dataset with all the
sap flow and environmental measurements, along with the metadata for the sites
aggregated, in order to work with the data in an easier way. This can be
done with the `metrics_tidyfier` function (see `?metrics_tidyfier`). But
`daily_metrics` and related functions also implement the `tidy` argument.
For the `tidy` argument to work, we must have available the metadata,
see the ["metadata section"](#metadatadatabase) for more details about this.

This allows for returning directly a metrics data frame combining all sites
aggregated along with their metadata, saving one step in the workflow:

```{r tidyfing}
temperate_tidy <- temperate_sites %>%
  daily_metrics(tidy = TRUE, metadata = sfn_metadata)

temperate_tidy
```

Now we can start analyzing, modeling, etc.  
For example, to look for site effects in the relationship between sap flow and
vpd, using the 0.95 quantile as maximum values of sap flow and the plant sapwood
area as a third variable:

```{r ex_1_plot, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.3}
ggplot(
  temperate_tidy,
  aes(x = vpd_mean, y = sapflow_q_95, colour = si_code, size = pl_sapw_area)
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```
